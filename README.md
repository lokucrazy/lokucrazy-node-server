# Lokucrazy Node Server

this is pretty much my personal node server I use for my own js/ts projects.  I don't really use bundlers like webpack or rollup, but setting up native es6 modules can be a pain so this server script allows me to easily do this.

## Flags:
- `--PORT, -p`
  - port number

## Example:
`npm run lokucrazy-node-server --PORT=9090`
